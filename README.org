** Convex Hull
Convex hull of set of points is the smallest convex polygon that contains all of the points.
Convex polygon is a polygon such that every line segment between any of two points within the polygon, is also contained inside that polygon.\\

*** Controls
N - add new convex hull \\
C - stitch/merge together last two convex hulls into a new convex hull \\ 
Space - clear all geometry \\
Esc - quit \\

** Voronoi Diagram
Given set of N points/sites in a plane, Voronoi diagram is a subdivision of a plane into N cells, corresponding to the points/sites.
Each cell is a convex polygon, such that the distance from any point inside the cell to its site is the smallest to any site. \\
